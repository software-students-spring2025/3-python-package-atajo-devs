## Features

**This package includes four exciting gaming-related functions:**

### 1. Game Guessing

This function is about to guess video games based on a given cryptic description. It compares the input description to a set of predefined hints and returns the closest matching game.

Matches the input description to known game hints using similarity comparison. Returns the closest matching game title. If no close match is found, selects a random game from a predefined list.

#### **Usage Example:**

Pass a cryptic game description as a string to get the best-matching game:

```
description = "A silent hero, a green outfit, a princess in distress."
print(guess_the_game(description))
```

Example Output:
```
The answer is The Legend of Zelda!
```

### 2. Gaming Luck Meter

This function predicts how lucky you will be in your gaming session today. It allows you to select a game genre and then generates a randomized luck percentage based on weighted probabilities, favoring higher luck outcomes.  

#### **Usage Example:**

Run the function to select a game genre and receive your luck prediction:  

```
üéÆ Choose your game type today:
  [FPS] - First-Person Shooter

print(get_fun_facts("Elden Ring"))  # Works normally
print(get_fun_facts("Baldurs Gate 3"))  # Fuzzy match suggests "Baldur's Gate 3"
print(get_fun_facts("Doom"))  # No match found
```
Example output:
```
üéÆ Fun fact about Elden Ring: One of the most iconic bosses, Malenia, has defeated millions of players worldwide.
